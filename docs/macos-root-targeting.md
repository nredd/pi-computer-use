# macOS root targeting

Fork notes for `nredd/pi-computer-use`. Contracts the macOS path guarantees.

## Target contract

- A root target is `{ pid, windowId?, rootRef?, windowRef? }`. `windowId` is present only when
  positive. An unpaired root (no matching CG window) has no `windowId`, never `0`.
- `rootRef` and `windowRef` are the same native ref. Every macOS helper call (`look`,
  `focusWindow`, `axWaitFor`) goes through `normalizeTarget()` in `src/platform/macos/backend.ts`,
  which sends only `windowRef`.
- The helper treats `windowId <= 0` as absent. A `windowRef` that no longer resolves fails; it
  never falls back to the app's first window.
- Looks remember their `windowRef`, so `act` resolves the root by ref for unpaired roots.

## Capture

- Paired root: semantic and visual observation work.
- Unpaired root: semantic works. Visual fails with `root_not_capturable`; use `image: never`.
  No other window is ever captured in its place.

## Modality

`isModal` is true for: a sheet child, role `AXSheet`, or `AXModal == true`. When the app does not
report `AXModal` at all, a dialog-like role/subrole still counts. An explicit `AXModal == false`
wins: Fusion's BROWSER sidebar (subrole `AXDialog`, `AXModal=0`) is nonmodal.

`act_ui` no longer redirects to a foreground modal. Actions and the successor capture stay on the
root the state belongs to; a modal that appears afterwards shows up in `rootDelta` as `appeared`.
`observe_ui` without a root may still prefer a confirmed foreground modal.

## Post-action outcomes

Terminal `act_ui` results always say the action was delivered, and:

- `target_closed`, `cause: replaced`, `successors: [...]`: source root gone and new roots of the
  same pid appeared. Observe a successor via `find_roots`.
- `target_closed`, `cause: closed`: source root gone, nothing replaced it.
- `post_action_observation_failed` with code `root_stale`: root still listed or unknown but the ref
  no longer resolves. Rediscover with `find_roots`.

## Ref lifecycle

Native refs live in the helper's `refStore` and are only valid while the helper process and the AX
element live. Refs from earlier sessions, pids and state ids are stale: rediscover with `find_roots`.

## Tests

`npm run test:macos-target`, `test:macos-native` (compiles the `PURE` region of `bridge.swift`),
`test:act-outcomes`.

## Real GUI validation

See the section below, filled in after running against live Fusion and Bambu Studio.
